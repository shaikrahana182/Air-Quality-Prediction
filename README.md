# Machine Learning-Based Forecasting of Air Pollution Levels
Forecasting Air Quality with Machine Learning

 # Abstract
Air quality deterioration poses severe risks to public health and ecosystems. This project applies machine learning techniques to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) by analyzing both pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors. Unlike traditional statistical methods, machine learning can capture nonlinear relationships, resulting in more precise forecasts.

# Objectives
Build a predictive model for AQI using historical pollutant and weather data,
Examine the contribution of each pollutant to AQI variation,
Provide short-term predictions to support public health advisories and policy decisions.
# Dataset Description
File: Air_Quality.csv
Features: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, O₃, Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Timestamp
Target Variable: AQI
# Methodology
Data preprocessing and handling of missing values,
Exploratory analysis of pollutant trends and seasonal effects,
Feature engineering and selection,
Model development using regression algorithms,
Performance evaluation with R², MAE, and RMSE metrics.
Tools and Frameworks
Python
Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Key Findings
AQI is strongly correlated with PM2.5 and PM10 levels,
Meteorological conditions significantly influence pollutant dispersion,
Machine learning models provide reliable short-term forecasts.
Future Enhancements
Integration with IoT air monitoring devices,
Incorporation of satellite imagery for large-scale analysis,
Deployment on cloud platforms for real-time monitoring.
